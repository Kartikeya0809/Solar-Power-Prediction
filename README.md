# Solar-Power-Prediction
Course Project of Statistical Machine Learning ( CSE 342 ) at IIIT-D

Problem Statement:
This project aims to develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting the solar power generated by two different solar power plants using data from their respective solar panels and weather sensors (temperature reports). By employing various regression techniques, our goal is to create models that effectively capture the relationship between input parameters such as irradiation, temperature, and DC power, and the corresponding solar power outputs. This project will enable us to forecast the power output of the plants over the next few days, facilitating better planning and management of solar energy resources.
